If you're new to the Wolfram Language üê∫, explore the following resources:

## An Elementary Introduction to the Wolfram Language
*Written by Stephen Wolfram*

- Paper version
- [Web version](https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/3rd-ed/)

This is a great starting point for beginners. All examples are written for *Wolfram Mathematica*, but __the majority are compatible with WLJS Notebook__ and its libraries.

## Mathematica Programming: An Advanced Introduction
*Written by Leonid Shifrin*

- [PDF version](./../MathProgrammingIntro.pdf)

Despite its title, this book __can be considered a general introduction to the Wolfram Language itself__, rather than being tied to a specific front end. It is an excellent match for WLJS Notebook as an execution environment.
