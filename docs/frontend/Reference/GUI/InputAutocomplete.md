```mathematica
InputAutocomplete[autocompleteFunction_, opts___] _EventObject
```

```mathematica
InputAutocomplete[autocompleteFunction_, default_String, opts___] _EventObject
```

renders an input field ([InputText](frontend/Reference/GUI/InputText.md)) with autocomplete generated by `autocompleteFunction`. This handler function should have the following structure

```mathematica
autocompleteFunction[input_String, callBack_] := With[{},
	...
	callBack[results]
];
```

where `results` is a sorted `List` of strings.

:::note
`cbk` may return `False` to cancel autocompletion 
:::

## Options
### `"Label"`
A text-label for the widget

### `"ClearOnSubmit"`
Keeps or clears out the input field when a users submitted the result. By the default is `True`. 

## Event generation
It fires two patterns
- `"Entered"` gives a string, which was entered by a user
- `"Selected"` gives a string, which was picked up by a user from the list, generated by `autocompleteFunction`

## Example
Find words starting with a given letters and speak them

```mathematica
EventHandler[InputAutocomplete[Function[{data, cbk},
  cbk[DictionaryLookup[data<>"*", 6]];
], "ClearOnSubmit"->False], Function[text,
  SpeechSynthesize[text, GeneratedAssetLocation -> None] // EmitSound
]]
```

Here we use a wild-card pattern, which does not differentiate between `Entered` and `Selected` there.
