## Options
### `"Window"`
By default, the `"Window"` option is set to `"Inherited"`. This setting *dynamically* uses the currently active window associated with the [`PlotlyInstance`](frontend/Reference/Plotly/PlotlyInstance.md).

When set to `"Inherited"`, even if a new window is opened using the same instance, it will be detected automatically. This is possible because all [`PlotlyInstance`](frontend/Reference/Plotly/PlotlyInstance.md) objects perform a handshake after mounting on the page.

To override this behavior, you can provide a specific [`WindowObj`](frontend/Reference/Frontend%20IO/WindowObj.md) as an option.
