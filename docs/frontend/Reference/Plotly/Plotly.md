```mathematica
Plotly[f, {x, xmin, xmax}]
```

mimics the behavior of a native [Plot](frontend/Reference/Plotting%20Functions/Plot.md) using a well-known [PlotlyJS](https://plotly.com/javascript/) library. It is quite limited and __does not support options__.

```mathematica
Plotly[data_Association, layout_Association:Null] _PlotlyInstance
```

creates `Plotly` instance object, which __gives a direct API access to a native Plotly Javascript engine__ âœ¨ and returns `PlotlyInstance`

`data` expression contains the parameters of a default Plotly Javascript constructor

:::tip
This is 1:1 correspondence to a normal Plotly API. Please see [Reference](https://plotly.com/javascript/)
:::

:::info
[RGBColor](frontend/Reference/Graphics/RGBColor.md) will also work normally as well as `ColorData` for coloring the plots. There is no need in JS/CSS-like color specifications
:::

## Constructor
Once called it returns `PlotlyInstance`

## Dynamics
It fully supports dynamics, but in a different way compared to other functions. Please see for that [PlotlyAddTraces](frontend/Reference/Plotly/PlotlyAddTraces.md), [PlotlyAnimate](frontend/Reference/Plotly/PlotlyAnimate.md) and etc.

## Examples

### Scatter plot
Adapted from [Ref](https://plotly.com/javascript/line-and-scatter/).

```mathematica
trace1 = <|
	"x" -> {1, 2, 3, 4}, 
	"y" -> {10, 15, 13, 17},
	"mode" -> "markers", 
	"type" -> "scatter" 
|>;

Plotly[trace1]
```

or with colors

```mathematica
trace1 = <| 
	"y" -> Table[5, {i, 1, 40}], 
	"mode" -> "markers", 
	"marker" -> <| 
		"size" -> 40, 
		"color" -> Range[40] 
	|> 
|>;

Plotly[trace1]
```

Adapted from PlotlyJS

```mathematica
data = Flatten[Table[{x,y,x y}, {x,-10,10}, {y,-10,10}],1] // Transpose;

data = <|
    "x" -> data[[1]],
    "y" -> data[[2]],
	"z" -> data[[3]],
