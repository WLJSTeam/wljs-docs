```

## Methods

```

## Options
### `ImageSize`
The effect is the same as if `{w_, h_}` or `w` were specified as a second argument.

### `FrameMargins`
Sets a margin to the content in *1/10 rem*

### `Background`

## Examples

```mathematica
Panel[i = InputRange[0,1,0.1], Style["My slider", 10]]
```

## Common issues
By the default it shows [StandardForm](frontend/Reference/Decorations/StandardForm.md) of expression passed as `titleLabel`. For string it will print double quotes as well. To remove them apply [Style](frontend/Reference/Graphics/Style.md)

```mathematica
Panel[123, Style["Title", 10]]
```
