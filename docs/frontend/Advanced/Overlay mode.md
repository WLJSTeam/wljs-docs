WLJS Notebook App registers a global shortcut to provide instant access to a floating bar with an empty input cell. This floating input cell does not belong to any notebook but functions like a normal one.

You have full access to any [Cell types](Cell%20types). You can even use it as a drawing board (see [Markdown](frontend/Cell%20types/Markdown.md) *Excalidraw*).

Or anything else you want.
