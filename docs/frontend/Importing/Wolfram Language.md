Text editor checks periodically if there were external changed made to a file and will update the content immediately.

:::note
All syntax sugar is compatible with [InputForm](frontend/Reference/Decorations/InputForm.md), which make it suitable for writting WL Packages using this text-editor. See more about syntax sugar here [Symbolic programming](frontend/Symbolic%20programming.md)
