__Sugared text editor for plain `.wl` files, just like in a notebook__

We provide a rich __text editor__ with full syntax sugar support for plain `.wl` (Wolfram Language) files. You can open any WL file directly from the sidebar.

:::info
The text editor periodically checks for external changes made to the file and will automatically update its content.

:::note
All syntax sugar is compatible with [InputForm](frontend/Reference/Formatting/InputForm.md), making it suitable for writing WL packages using this text editor. Learn more about syntax sugar in the [Symbolic Programming](frontend/Symbolic%20programming.md) section.
