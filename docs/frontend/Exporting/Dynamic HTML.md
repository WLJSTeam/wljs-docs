This is a dynamic version of exporter [Static HTML](frontend/Exporting/Static%20HTML.md), which is aimed to recreate full interactivity of the normal notebooks

## Use cases
- All use cases of [Static HTML](frontend/Exporting/Static%20HTML.md)
- Demonstration project
- Live animation of some physical process

## How it works
It order to make the system more general and be able to capture the effects of [ManipulatePlot](frontend/Reference/Plotting%20Functions/ManipulatePlot.md), any combinations of [InputRange](frontend/Reference/GUI/InputRange.md), [InputButton](frontend/Reference/GUI/InputButton.md), [Offload](frontend/Reference/Interpreter/Offload.md) and many more it is abstracted by the design from the controlling elements and purely analyses the events and mutations of symbols.

> It requires the architecture of your dynamic system, which follows the principle of *call and response*, i.e. it must generate (by a user or automatically) an event from the input element or any other code on the frontend and then generate the corresponding response as a mutations of symbols used from the Wolfram Kernel.

:::note
TLDR; We record the calculated data for all possible combinations of input elements used and store it in a large table. See how to do this in [How to use](#How%20to%20use) section

### Sniffer
All magic happens on the frontend in Javascript. The first stage it is to record all events fired by `server.kernel.io.fire` (see here [API](https://jerryi.github.io/wlx-docs/docs/Reference/Misc/WLJSTransport#server) reference), which is a part of ``JerryI`Misc`WLJS`Transport`` core package, that provides an easy interface between kernel [events system](frontend/Reference/Misc/Events.md) and Javascript together with symbols mutations. `.fire()` method __is used in all built-in input elements__ such as [InputRange](frontend/Reference/GUI/InputRange.md), [InputText](frontend/Reference/GUI/InputText.md), [InputJoystick](frontend/Reference/GUI/InputJoystick.md) (see an example on how to built your own in [Communication](frontend/Advanced/Javascript/Communication.md) guide) and even [AnimationFrameListener](frontend/Reference/Graphics3D/AnimationFrameListener.md). Symbols mutations are recorded only for ones wrapped in [Offload](frontend/Reference/Interpreter/Offload.md), which is a usual case scenario for any kind of [Dynamics](frontend/Dynamics.md) in WLJS Notebook

#### Analyser
Since Wolfram Engine is single threaded as well as Javascript, it is easy to spot a correlation between events and symbols mutations. For example let us have a look at the recorded time-series 

```
A 1 B 2 C 1 2
```

here `A`, `B`, `C` are some arbitrary event and `1`, `2` are symbols mutations. By analyzing this series it is easy to guess that the connections are following

- `A` mutates `1`
- `B` mutates `2`
- `C` mutates `1` and `2`

It also accounts for a possible delay and "noise" (rare events from other subsystems you don't want to include to your exported notebook) in computing, i.e.

```
A 1 B B B 2 2 2 V C 1 2 C C 1 2 1 2 A B 1 2
```

will also be processed correctly assuming you have enough sampled data. By also analyzing the payload of each call, system can make a guess

```
A 1 A 1 A 1 A 1 A 1 ... 20-60 times per second
```

if the payload of an event `A` is the same, then `1` is most likely a frame of some animation constructed using [AnimationFrameListener](frontend/Reference/Graphics/AnimationFrameListener.md). 

If we know from this data all connections and the range of values for each event, it will be enough to reproduce this behavior offline using look-up tables and state machines.

### Sampler
After all connections are known, the idea is to sample the data of symbol mutations using all combinations of events recursively. This is not the best solution, since having 1 checkbox and 2 sliders (with 10 positions for instance) already gives `200` sampling points. If an animation process is not detected, an automatic sampling will be applied starting from the current state of a system

```
*.emitt('A', 1)               //manually fire
                              //wait for 1
* mutation('1', {new data 1}) //collect
*.emitt('A', 2)               //manually fire
                              //wait for 1
* mutation('1', {new data 2}) //collect
...
*.emitt('B', 1)               //manually fire
                              //wait for 2
* mutation('2', {new data 1}) //collect
...
*.emitt('C', 1)               //manually fire
                              //wait for 1 & 2
* mutation('1', {new data 3}) //collect 
* mutation('2', {new data 3}) //collect 
...
```

After all data has been harvested, it is translated into a big hash map with each entity corresponding to single state of a system - sort of a loop-up table. The state is determined by the sum of hashes (fingerprints) of all fired events including the their payload

![](./../../Pasted%20image%2020241117185053.png)

In this implementation it is impossible to mimic Markov chains or other systems with internal state and a history (hysteresis loops). 

Then a sampler compresses all data using `zlib` and packs it together with an exported notebook to a single HTML file including the supporting code for .

## How to use
Please follow the steps listed below 
### Prepare notebook
Connect to Wolfram Kernel, do normal evaluation of your dynamics. Try to minimize the number of input elements and their possible states. For example, do not put 3 slider ([InputRange](frontend/Reference/GUI/InputRange.md)) with 100 steps for each. If you use [ManipulatePlot](frontend/Reference/Plotting%20Functions/ManipulatePlot.md), specify explicitly `step` for your parameters. The same counts for number and size of used dynamic symbols.

:::note
If you record an animation constructed using [AnimationFrameListener](frontend/Reference/Graphics/AnimationFrameListener.md), start it __right before going to the next step__. Note, that the effects of [`SetInterval`](frontend/Reference/Misc/Async.md#`SetInterval`) as well as [FrontSubmit](frontend/Reference/Frontend%20IO/FrontSubmit.md) will not be recorded at all. 
:::

For example, we can try [ManipulatePlot](frontend/Reference/Plotting%20Functions/ManipulatePlot.md) for the simplicity

```mathematica @
ManipulatePlot[(*TB[*)Sum[(*|*)(*FB[*)((Sin[2\[Pi](2j - 1) x])(*,*)/(*,*)(2j - 1))(*]FB*)(*|*), {(*|*)j(*|*),(*|*)1(*|*),(*|*)n(*|*)}](*|*)(*1:eJxTTMoPSmNiYGAoZgMSwaW5TvkVmYwgPguQCCkqTQUAeAcHBQ==*)(*]TB*), {x, -1,1}, {n, 1,10,1}]
```

### Sniffing phase
Click `Share` and pick `Dynamic Notebook`, it will automatically initiate recording. A widget should appear in the top-right corner

:::info
If you record an animation. Just evaluate the corresponding cell and wait number of frames you want to be recorded, then click `Continue` on the widget
:::

![](./../../Screenshot%202024-08-03%20at%2015.47.04.png)

Now drag a slider in all ranges. It is important to cover all positions of it, since while sampling phase it will only use values it had during [Sniffing phase](#Sniffing%20phase).

:::tip
If you have multiple input elements (2, 3 sliders). Drag each individually in full range __one time__. Cross combinations are not necessary, since they will be sampled automatically recursively on the next stage by the system.
:::

![](./../../Screenshot%202024-08-03%20at%2015.49.58.png)

Now you see found connections between symbols and events. Their names do not manner, since it is autogenerated by [ManipulatePlot](frontend/Reference/Plotting%20Functions/ManipulatePlot.md). Make sure they become __green__, which means a good confidence in the corresponding bond. 

### Sampling phase
Now it samples all combinations automatically, it might take some time depending on how complex your calculations

![](./../../sampled-ezgif.com-optimize.gif)

This is the last stage. On the next step it will export your notebook with this data to your drive. Click `Continue`

### Result
Depending on how many sampling points you have, the average file size is about `7-20` Mb and `3-15` Mb of you set `CDN` in the settings (see [Static HTML](frontend/Exporting/Static%20HTML.md)). An example above costs only `165` kB uncompressed and `50` kB compressed data.

The result is fully interactive widget working offline without internet connection and any Wolfram Kernel âœ¨
