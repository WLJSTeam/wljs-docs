## Support Us

As an open-source initiative, our mission is to bring the power of Wolfram Language computationâ€”traditionally associated with heavyweight closed commercial toolsâ€”into a portable, browser-based environment. Developed through the collective effort of physicists and programmers this freeware notebook environment helps in solving real-world scientific challenges, teach students complex concepts from science more intuitively, and explore mathematics and computational thinking in a more interactive and accessible way using symbolic programming paradigm.

Your contributions directly support:

- **Ongoing Development & Maintenance:**  
  We continuously update our platform to ensure compatibility with the latest Wolfram Engine, introduce new features, and refine the performance of 2D/3D graphics, dynamic notebooks, data-driven presentations and many more.
  
- **Documentation & Tutorials**  

- **Coffee machine capsules** 
  To stay awake after work and work on your submitted issues and questions
  
**Every contribution, no matter how small or large, makes a difference.**
